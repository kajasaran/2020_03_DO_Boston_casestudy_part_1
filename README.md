In this project we are going to see various steps to create a pipeline which gets triggered based on code changes in Git.

Tools and services used in this pipeline are:-
1) git
2) Jenkins
3) Docker
4) DockerHub
5) Ansible
6) Kubernetes

The various steps we would see in this pipeline are described in this [Presentation](https://github.com/kajasaran/2020_03_DO_Boston_casestudy_part_1/blob/main/Pipeline_Project_Saran.pdf)
